## Why Linear Algebra ?

In the field of data science ,we come acroos 2-,3-,4- dimensional spatial quantities.To deal with these problems ,there is a need for us to learn Linear Algebra as we will perform matrix decompositions on these n-dimensional vectors.  
In data science any statistical model with more than handful of parameters are represented as vectors or matrices.Linear Algebra helps in fitting these models,making predictions and so on.  

In this tutorial we will start with basics of Linear Algebra.
